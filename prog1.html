        <p>Questo è un progetto che ho relizzato all'inzio della mia esperienza con HTML/CSS.
            Molto semplice, ho immaginato che sia una sorta "telaio", per un eventuale blog futuro.</p>

        <p>Questo è un testo di una delle mie canzoni preferite.<br>
            All of the perfection nothing will and can be made
            The old skin has to shed before the new one sees the day
            Opportunities to find the deeper powers in ourselves
            Come when life is breathing and seem more than what it is
            Go blindly completely
            You tell me how I can fly away
            And believe that all the angels are coming
            You bring me down then I will fly again
            And believe that all the angels are coming
            The kingdom of the fathers and the heroes where are you
            I'm talking to you every night more than I should do
            What awaits and when will be the day
            When I can wear the cape
            I'm lying on the ground as always staring into the air
            Go blindly completely
            You tell me how I can fly away
            And believe that all the angels are coming
            You bring me down then I will fly again
            And believe that all the angels are coming
            The stars are long gone but we can still see their glow
            Long after they've skidded off into oblivion
